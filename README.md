# library
Type library for Defold [extensions](https://defold.com/assets/).

## Contributing

See the [template](https://github.com/ts-defold/library/tree/main/template) folder for an example of how to format your types.

- `undefined` is used to represent Lua's `nil` type, as recommended by [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/caveats/#undefined-and-null).
