  /**
   * Setup the A* pathfinding algorithm.
   * @param map_width Width of your map. This is generally width of your tilemap.
   * @param map_height Height of your map. This is generally width of your tilemap.
   * @param direction Movement direction. You have two options:
   *  - astar.DIRECTION_FOUR: On a square grid that allows 4 directions of movement using Manhattan distance
   *  - astar.DIRECTION_EIGHT: On a square grid that allows 8 directions of movement using Euclidean distance
   * @param allocate How many states should be internally allocated at a time. This can be hard to get correct. The higher the value, the more memory Patfinder will use.
   *  - If you have a small map (a few thousand states?) it may make sense to pass in the maximum value. This will cache everything, and MicroPather will only need one main memory allocation. For a chess board, allocate would be set to 8x8 (64)
   *  - If your map is large, something like 1/4 the number of possible states is good.
   *  - If your state space is huge, use a multiple (5-10x) of the normal path. "Occasionally" call `astar.reset_cache()` to free unused memory.
   * @param typical_adjacent Used to determine cache size. The typical number of adjacent states to a given state. (On a chessboard, 8.) Higher values use a little more memory.
   * @param cache Turn on path caching. Uses more memory (yet again) but at a huge speed advantage if you may call the pather with the same path or sub-path, which is common for pathing over maps in games.
